## Installation

```lua
-- packer
use {
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-early-retirement",
	config = function () require("early-retirement").setup() end,
}

-- lazy.nvim
{
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-early-retirement",
	config = true,
	event = "VeryLazy",
},
```

## Configuration

```lua
-- default values
opts = {
	-- if a buffer has been inactive for this many minutes, close it
	retirementAgeMins = 20,

	-- filetypes to ignore
	ignoredFiletypes = {},

	-- will not close the alternate file
	ignoreAltFile = true,

	-- will ignore buffers with unsaved changes. If false, the buffers will
	-- automatically be written and then closed.
	ignoreUnsavedChangesBufs = true,

	-- ignore non-empty buftypes, e.g. terminal buffers
	ignoreSpecialBuftypes = true,

	-- ignore visible buffers (buffers open in a window, "a" in `:buffers`)
	ignoreVisibleBufs = true,

	-- uses vim.notify for plugins like nvim-notify
	notificationOnAutoClose = false,
}
```
